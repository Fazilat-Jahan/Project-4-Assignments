A program which prompts the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit (this can be a number with decimal places!) and outputs the temperature converted to Celsius.

The equation use for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius is the following:

degrees = (degrees_fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0/9.0

e.g:
Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: 76

Temperature: 76.0F = 24.444444444444443C
