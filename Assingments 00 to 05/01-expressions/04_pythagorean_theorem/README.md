A program that asks the user for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!

The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.

For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:

BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2
